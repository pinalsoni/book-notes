## Chapter 3. Gherkin Basics
### Feature description:
- Summary documentation about a group of tests
- Line cannot begin with ‘Scenario’, ‘Background’ and ‘Scenario Outline’
- Use the feature injection template to describe a feature: In order to <goal>, As a <stakeholder>, I want <a feature>

#### Naming feature file
Use feature description with a standardized naming scheme such as all lower case with connecting underscores.

### Scenarios (and Steps): Focus on WHAT
- Expresses behavior we want
- 1:N Feature:Scenario
- All scenarios collectively provide expected behavior of the feature itself
- Scenario should be testing meaningful functionality of your system
- Use scenarios to explore edge cases and different paths through a feature
- **Scenario pattern:** similar to (Arrange, Act, Assert) => context, event and an outcome
- Always make scenarios stateless (one scenario should not depend on outcome of others)
- Scenario lines are steps; add more steps to each Given, When and Then using the keywords And and But
- Keep sceanario description up to date to reflect what is being tested - this helps avoid confusion
- Put a #language comment on the first line of a feature file; defaults to English unless explicitly configured
- Language setting is applied to all scenarios in a feature file
- The choice of keywords is simply there to help create readable scenario

#### Naming scenarios:
- Use a concise, expressive name; helps avoid reading all the steps of the scenario
- when tests break, it’s the failing scenario’s name that helps you understand breakage
- Well-composed scenario name will still make sense in case of adding extra steps in future
- Avoid putting anything about the outcome of the scenarios into the name C
- Concentrate on summarizing the context and event of the scenario

### Concrete Examples
Help everyone in the team understand what we want the software to do and hence facilitates better communication between developers and stakeholders which further reduces waste.
- Use real world examples to describe the desired behavior of the system we want to build
- Examples stimulate our imagination, enabling us to explore and discover edge cases we might otherwise have found later
- Examples help us turn acceptance criterion into an acceptance test
- Much easier to validate against the running system than vague requirement statements
- Use language and terminology that makes sense to stakeholders
- Look for precision in acceptance criteria and don't leave a room for interpretation through vague statements in AC
- Precise ACs help both devs and stakeholders understand what we are going to build; help remove ambiguity


## Chapter 4. Step Definitions: From the Outside In
Step defs focus on HOW - tells cucumber _how_ you want it to poke around with the system.

### Matching Step:
- Steps are expressed as plain text
- Cucumber scans the text of each step for patterns that recognizes, which are defined using regexes
- Annotations: Just there for extra documentation to help express the intent of each step or step def
- Will match any gherkin step as long as the reg ex matches the main text of the step
- Choose wordings of steps carefully to avoid ambiguity. Focus on communicating what exactly the steps will do when executed.

### Specificity vs. Flexibility
- Specific scenarios are great but limit reuse. To enable this and making scenarios much more flexible, capture arguments in scenarios.
- In regex, two features that can help us with making scenarios  flexible are: 1. Capture groups 2. Wildcards

### Capture Arguments in Step Definitions:

#### Capture groups
Surround part of a reg ex with parantheses. Used to highlight particular parts of a pattern that you want to lift out of the matching text and use

**Wild cards**
_Alternation_
- Provide different options separated by a pipe
- Useful when there are fixed set of values that you want to accept in your step def

_The Dot_
- Metacharacter, matches any single character
- Can be escaped by preceding them with a backslash
NOTE: $ itself is a meta character and hence it is preceeded with backslashes

_The Star: (greedy operator)_
- Repeatition - any number of times

_Character classes_
- Allows you to tell the regex expression engine to match one of a range of characters
- Simply place all of the chars you would accept inside square brackets
- Continuous range of characters: Use hyphen
- Shorthand character classes:
        \d  - shorthand for [0 - 9]
        \w - shorthand for word; underscore and digits are included but not hyphens
        \s - whitespace character, typically [\t\r\n]
        \b - word boundary: anything that is not a word character is a word boundary
        \D - any character except a digit
 _The Plus_
 - ‘+’ modifier means at least once  

#### Multiple Captures:
- OK to use multiple capture group in our regex
- Cucumber will pass an argument in a method for every capture group in regex
- Flexibility:
  - Encourage our feature authors to be consistent about the nouns and verbs
  - Express as naturally as possible; usage of slightly different phrasing to mean exactly the same thing
  
#### Noncapturing Groups:
- Helps recognize multiple phrases
- The ?: at the start of the group marks it as noncapturing, meaning Cucumber won’t pass it as an argument to our block

#### Anchors:
- Not mandatory; steps start with a ^ and ends with a $
- Keep your regular expressions tight to avoid step definitions clashing with each other.

#### Reporting Results
Cucumber communicates results by either throwing or not throwing an exception. Status could be one of the following:
 Failed. Pending, Undefined, Skipped and Passed

_Pending vs. Undefined status_
**Pending step definitions** are halfway through being implemented; it marks the step as pending (yellow); sceanrio will be stopped and the rest of the steps will be skipped or marked as undefined. Can be used to signal in-progress work or to-do items. 

**Undefined step definitions** are the ones that do not exist yet (cucumber failed to find those during execution).
